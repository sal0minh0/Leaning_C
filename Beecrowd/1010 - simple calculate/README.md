>>> Read the code of a product 1, the number of units of product 1 (integers), the price for one unit of product 1 (double), the code of a product 2, the number of units of product 2 (integers), and the price for one unit of product 2 (double), calculate and print the amount (VALOR A PAGAR) to be paid (double) with 2 digits after the decimal point;

>>> Logic: Do the product of the units (1,2) and the prices (1,2) and sum them all.
