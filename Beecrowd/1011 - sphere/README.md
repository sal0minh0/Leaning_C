>>> Read one double value: the radius and calculate the volume of a sphere, using the formula (4/3) * pi * R^3  (pi is 3.14159) and print the result(VOLUME), with 3 digits after the decimal point;

>>> Logic: Calculate (using 4/3.0 or 4.0/3, because some languages (including C++) assume that the division's result between two integers is another integer).
